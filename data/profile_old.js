    title: "Full-Stack Web Developer | Software Engineer | AI/ML & Data Analytics",
    description: "I'm a full-stack developer with a solid track record of building and shipping production-ready web apps. My work centers on the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) and modern tools such as Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Prisma, and PostgreSQL. I deploy to Vercel and AWS, use CI/CD pipelines, and design for scalability from day one. Several of my projects—PromptPilot, NovaDraft, SyncSlate, and FinSight-AI—showcase this range: AI-powered chat platforms, content-creation suites, scheduling systems, and finance apps that blend polished UX with real-time data and cloud-native architecture. I also work at the intersection of AI/ML and data analytics, integrating OpenAI/Gemini APIs and leveraging SQL, Power BI, Tableau, and Google Data Analytics to turn raw data into actionable insights. During my Software Engineer Internship at Softmaque Consulting, I built key features for an enterprise-grade Defect Tracking and Workflow Management System using ASP.NET, SQL Server, jQuery, and AJAX. I implemented role-based UI, dynamic notifications, and Excel ingestion that improved QA speed and accuracy across the company.",

      abstract: "This research presents a Precision Robotics Arm System based on Computer Vision, uniquely integrating Raspberry Pi 4 and Arduino Uno in synchronization for real-time AI-driven automation. It combines YOLOv4 object detection (trained on 12,000 images) with PWM-controlled servos to achieve ±0.5° precision in robotic arm movement. An optimized Serial UART protocol ensures low-latency data transfer, and Inverse Kinematics guarantees accuracy. The system runs at 15 FPS with 120ms latency, integrates MQTT for IoT monitoring, and achieves 91.78% accuracy.",
