## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Setup environment (optional for enhanced features):**
   ```bash
   cp .env.local.example .env.local
   ```
   
   Edit `.env.local` and add your GitHub token:
   ```
   GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_your_token_here
   GITHUB_LOGIN=AnsariTech-25667
   ```

3. **Start development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Open http://localhost:3000** (or the port shown in terminal)

## 🔧 GitHub Token Setup (Optional)

For live GitHub data, create a token at https://github.com/settings/tokens with `public_repo` scope.

Without the token, the app shows:
- Static repository cards with curated content
- Friendly message about token setup
- All other features work normally

## 📦 New Dependencies Added

- `react-tsparticles` + `tsparticles` - Galaxy particles system
- `graphql-request` - GitHub GraphQL client
- `react-activity-calendar` - Contribution heatmap
